Note: I've included a mix of humanoids, aliens, and mixed species to reflect the diversity of the Andromeda Galaxy. I've also tried to create unique environments, such as toxic atmospheres or hostile terrain, to provide opportunities for exploration and challenge. Let me know if you'd like me to add anything else!
