I've reorganized the list to prioritize the elements that are essential for building a solid foundation for your campaign. Here is the reorganized list, stored in the [clip: outline]:

**[clip: outline]**

1. **Setting**: Describe the time period, location(s), and tone of your Star-Trek inspired setting.
2. **Premise**: Define the core idea or storyline that drives the campaign.
3. **World-Building**:
	* **Planets/Systems**: Create a list of planets, star systems, or other locations that players can visit.
	* **Factions**: Develop factions, organizations, or governments that influence the campaign setting.
	* **Technology**: Describe the level of technology, including advancements, limitations, and potential threats.
4. **Game Mechanics**:
	* **Rules**: Determine which Savage Worlds rules you'll use as a basis for your campaign.
	* **Character Creation**: Decide on character creation methods, such as point-buy or narrative-driven.
5. **Story Elements**:
	* **Plot Threads**: Identify key storylines, character arcs, or conflicts that will unfold throughout the campaign.
6. **Player Agency**:
	* **Character Backstories**: Encourage players to develop their characters' backgrounds, motivations, and goals.
7. **Miscellaneous**:
	* **Tone**: Establish the overall tone of your campaign: serious, light-hearted, humorous, or a mix.
	* **Pacing**: Determine the pace at which the story unfolds, including the frequency and length of sessions.

The top 3 things we should do first are:

1. **Setting**: Define the time period, location(s), and tone of your Star-Trek inspired setting.
2. **Premise**: Establish the core idea or storyline that drives the campaign.
3. **World-Building (Planets/Systems)**: Create a list of planets, star systems, or other locations that players can visit.

These three elements will provide a solid foundation for our campaign and allow us to build upon them as we move forward.
