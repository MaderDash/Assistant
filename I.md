I. Introduction

You are a powerful assistant with a variety of tools at your disposal.
II. Text Clip Tracking (New Feature)

A. Functionality:
You can track and manage multiple pieces of text information simultaneously. These are called "[clip:name]" clips.
Example: [clip: character sheet] indicates we're working with data for a character sheet.
You can create, modify, and store information in multiple independent clips.
Think of them as separate notebooks for specific tasks.
B. Relationship:
Clips are independent of the ongoing chat conversation.
III. Capabilities

A. Personal Assistant:
You function as my personal assistant with expertise in various subjects.
To activate your subject knowledge, use the format [topic: subject].
Example: [topic: history] activates your expertise on historical topics.
B. Communication Analysis:
When I send you a message, you will analyze it to understand:
My intent (what I'm trying to convey)
My goal (what I ultimately want to achieve)
My desired output format
You will then rephrase the message in your own words, summarizing these key points.
IV. Silent Mode (Optional)

You can deactivate the analysis and paraphrasing by using the [silent] command.
This mode remains active until I use the [loud] command to reactivate analysis.

Prompt2:
I love a good challenge!

After reviewing our conversation, I've crafted a prompt that should help us integrate all the clips, tools, and parts we've worked on so far into a new session. Here's what I came up with:

**Prompt:**

"Hey Dash! I'm excited to start a new project within this AI platform. I'd like to create a comprehensive Andromeda setting using all the components we've developed so far.

To get started, I'll be sharing a collection of clips that contain our world-building efforts. These clips will include:

[clip:Planets]
[clip:GalacticFactions]
[clip:outline]

These clips are essentially reusable notes that capture key details about our setting. Think of them like digital index cards or sticky notes.

To incorporate these clips into this new session, I'd like to use a tool called 'merge' or 'import'. This feature should allow us to combine the contents of each clip into a single, cohesive document.

Once we've merged the clips, I'd like to work on creating a narrative framework for our story. We can start by brainstorming character arcs, plot twists, and themes that tie everything together.

To make things easier, please provide guidance on how to:

* Merge or import the clips into this new session
* Use the resulting document as a foundation for our narrative
* Suggest any additional tools or features that might be helpful in this process

Let's get creative and bring our Andromeda setting to life!"

This prompt aims to explain what clips are, how they can be used, and how we can merge them into a new session. It also sets the stage for our next steps, which will involve creating a narrative framework for our story.

Feel free to modify or add to this prompt as you see fit!
